# CI/CD Pipelines

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository.
- Automated builds and tests run to detect errors early.
- Ensures new code integrates well with the existing system.

## Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
- After CI, the code is automatically prepared for release, but deployment may require manual approval.
- Automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications.

### Benefits of CI/CD
*  Faster development cycles.  
*  Reduced bugs and errors in production.  
*  Automated and reliable software releases.  
*  Improved collaboration among development teams.

# What is Jenkins?
**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used for **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)**. It helps automate software development processes like building, testing, and deploying applications.

* It is NOT just for CI/CD

### Benefits of Jenkins
-  Faster software deployment.
-  Improved software quality through automated testing and code stability.
-  Scalable and flexible.
-  Large plugin ecosystem for integration with various tools.
-  Reduces human intervention in CD.
-  Seamless integration with DevOps tools.

### How Jenkins Works
1. **Developers commit code** → Push changes to a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. **Jenkins detects changes** → Automatically triggers a build.
3. **Build & Test** → Jenkins compiles the code and runs automated tests.
4. **Deploy** → If tests pass, Jenkins deploys the application (e.g., to a staging or production server).

# Business Value of CI/CD
Building a CI/CD pipeline isn’t just a technical upgrade—it’s a **business enabler**. It helps organizations:

*  Deliver **faster & better** software.  
*  Reduce **costs & risks**.  
*  Increase **customer satisfaction & revenue**.
